# Strongest-Path

Let G(V, E) be an undirected graph where V is a set of nodes and E a set of edges. Each edge e ∈ E is associated with a weight w, 0 < w < 1. We define the strength of a path (n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n k ) as w 1 × w2 × . . . × w k−1 , where w i is the
weight of the edge between n i and n i+1 .
Given a node n (called source node) and a set of nodes {n 1 , . . . , n k } (called target nodes), you are required to write a program to find the strongest path (a path with the largest strength) from the source node to each of the target nodes.
